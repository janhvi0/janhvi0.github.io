### 👩‍💻 Data Analyst 

Hi, I’m Janhvi Patriwar, a B.Tech grad who fell head over heels for the world of data! From coding to analyzing, I found my sweet spot in the data field. I’m all about Python, SQL, and turning numbers into stories. Oh, and I love making data look fancy with visualizations and dashboards!

From cleaning messy datasets to creating visualizations that even my grandma would understand, I’m all about making data cool. 

I geek out over Python, SQL, and Excel, but my true superpower? Crafting dashboards that wow the room.

Honed my data analysis chops and mastered the art of explaining complex stuff to non-techies!


## 💡 Projects

**🚴‍♂️ Analyzing Bike Sales Data (SQL & Power BI)**
**What I did:** Dug deep into motorcycle parts sales data to track performance across three warehouses. Created SQL queries that analyzed monthly net revenue by product line and location.

**Impact:** Developed a Power BI dashboard that brought this data to life with stunning visuals. The dashboard helped the company spot revenue trends and identify top-performing warehouses—data-driven decisions FTW!

**Fun fact:** I designed the dashboard to be interactive, so it’s like a choose-your-own-adventure but with data! 📊

**🔋 Electric Vehicle Market in India (Excel & Power BI)**

**What I did:** Analyzed EV market trends from 2015-2024 by crunching historical sales data, then projected future growth using Excel and Power BI.

**Impact:** Created KPIs and built a dashboard that visualized the growth trajectory for stakeholders. The insights helped key players in the EV industry make predictions about where the market’s headed next!

**Fun fact:** With interactive filters and sleek design, this dashboard turned EV market analysis into something even a non-tech person could geek out over. 🔌🚗

**🤖 GENAI Chatbot (JavaScript)**

**What I did:** Built a chatbot with a serious attitude problem (in a good way!). Using JavaScript, LangChain, and Express, I programmed it to deliver hilariously sarcastic responses.

**Impact:** The chatbot added a fun twist to human-computer interactions, perfect for users who like a little sass with their tech.

**Fun fact:** The chatbot was designed for a customer-facing project, and users loved the witty replies. Think of it as the Ryan Reynolds of chatbots. 😏
